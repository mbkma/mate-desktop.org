## The MATE Desktop Environment

MATE is a fork of GNOME 2. It provides an intuitive and attractive desktop environment using traditional metaphors for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems.

The name "MATE" comes from the South American plant *yerba mate* and the drink made from it.

## History

MATE was started in 2011 as a response to the reception of GNOME 3, which abandoned the traditional desktop metaphor. MATE continues the GNOME 2 desktop experience, providing a classic, familiar interface for users who prefer the traditional desktop paradigm.

The project began when Perberos, an Arch Linux user, started the fork. Since then, MATE has grown into a mature, stable desktop environment used by hundreds of thousands of people worldwide.

## Philosophy

- **Tradition** - We believe the traditional desktop metaphor works well and should be preserved
- **Stability** - A reliable desktop that doesn't change for the sake of change
- **Accessibility** - Everyone should be able to use their computer effectively
- **Customization** - Users should control their desktop, not the other way around
- **Performance** - Efficient use of system resources without sacrificing features
