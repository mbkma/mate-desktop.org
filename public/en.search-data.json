MATE continues the GNOME 2 desktop experience, providing a classic, familiar interface for users who prefer the traditional desktop paradigm.\nThe project began when Perberos, an Arch Linux user, started the fork. Since then, MATE has grown into a mature, stable desktop environment used by hundreds of thousands of people worldwide.","philosophy#Philosophy":"Tradition - We believe the traditional desktop metaphor works well and should be preserved Stability - A reliable desktop that doesn’t change for the sake of change Accessibility - Everyone should be able to use their computer effectively Customization - Users should control their desktop, not the other way around Performance - Efficient use of system resources without sacrificing features","support-the-project#Support the Project":"MATE is free software developed by volunteers.

to GTK3+ and adopting new technologies to replace some of deprecated components MATE Desktop 1.16 still relied on.\nThe headline changes in MATE Desktop 1.18 are:\nThe entire MATE Desktop suite of applications and components is now GTK3+ only! Requires GTK+ \u003e= 3.14. All GTK2+ code has been dropped including the --with-gtk build option. Completed the migration to GtkApplication from libunique. Added libinput support for mouse and touchpad. Separate settings for handedness (left/right-handed) and motion acceleration/threshold. Much improved accessibility support (particularly for visually impaired users). Many thanks to our friends at Hypra.fr for their contribution! Caja adds several new features including: Added a copy queue and copy pausing. Asking confirmation before moving files to the Trash. Support for back/forward mouse buttons for directory navigation. Notification when ejected drives are safe to unplug. Lock screen will load the users selected background instead of the system defined default. MATE Panel gets several improvements, including: Added desktop actions support for additional launch options. Added StatusNotifier support. Added support for Menulibre menu editor, if installed it is preferred over Mozo. Engrampa, the archive manager, includes a number of improvements: Added ear and war to the supported types list. Check the rar/unrar version if the correct date is shown. Fixed compress rar and 7z split into volumes. Notifications now implement action icons support, for example playback control icons used by media players. Reworked the font viewer to add font browsing mode, support for TTC fonts and expose it in the menus by default. Replaced deprecated upower suspend/hibernate functions with ConsoleKit2 equivalents. MATE Terminal adds the ability to close tabs with middle mouse button. Atril, the document viewer, has much improved page load times and adds support for unarchiver used by some comics. Lots of deprecated GTK+ methods have been replaced and many bugs have been fixed. The plugin systems, and all C and Python plugins, in Eye of MATE and Pluma have been ported to libpeas. Translations are updated. Thank you to our team of translators! A number of memory leaks have been plugged.

stabilising the MATE Desktop by replacing deprecated code and modernising large sections of the code base. We’ve also improved our window manager (Marco) and added support for HiDPI. Along the way we’ve fixed hundreds of bugs. Squished ’em dead!\nThe headline changes in MATE Desktop 1.20 are:\nMATE Desktop 1.20 supports HiDPI displays with dynamic detection and scaling. HiDPI hints for Qt applications are also pushed to the environment to improve cross toolkit integration. Toggling HiDPI modes triggers dynamic resize and scale, no log out/in required. Marco now supports DRI3 and XPresent, if available. Frame rates in games are significantly increased when using Marco. Marco now supports drag to quadrant window tiling, cursor keys can be used to navigate the Alt + Tab switcher and keyboard shortcuts to move windows to another monitor were added. Support for Global Menu providers such as vala-panel-appmenu has been added. MATE Panel has much improved Status Notifier Items (SNI) support. Bookmarks now support GTK3+ locations. MATE Terminal now supports background images, adds Solarized themes and keybindings to switch tabs. Atril, the document viewer, has had a massive overhaul and is better in every single way. Yes, all ways. Better! In particular accessibility support for visually impaired users is considerably improved. Caret navigation has been added. The Invest applet has been dropped from MATE Applets. The API, provided by Yahoo, has been discontinued and there is no reputable drop in replacement available. Panel applets now size correctly based on the units being displayed and many graphs are dynamically scaled. MATE Themes have seen significant improvements to fully implement all style classes exposed by GTK 3.22 Engrampa, the archive viewer, has improved support for encrypted 7z archives. MATE Sensors Applet (finally) supports udisks2. OpenBSD authentication is supported in MATE Screensaver and minizip in Atril supports more BSD variants. Translations are updated. Thank you to our team of translators! A-n-d for distro maintainers we’ve bumped the minimum GTK3+ and GLib requirements. GTK 3.22 and GLib 2.50 or newer are required to build MATE Desktop 1.20. You might see some references to Wayland in the changelog below, don’t get too excited. It’s not what you think :-) The various components of MATE Desktop 1.20 are available for download here:\nhttps://pub.mate-desktop.org/releases/1.20/"},"title":"MATE 1.20 released"},"/blog/2019-03-18-mate-1-22-released/":{"data":{"":"After about a year of development, the MATE Desktop team have finally released MATE 1.22.

Some of the big highlights include:\nThe MATE panel has gotten a crazy amount of rework to make it work with Wayland display backend The display applet got a full revamp, allowing for better monitor control directly from the panel The timer applet now has much better mouse interaction Wanda the Fish now works properly on HiDPI displays (fish image is still pixelated, keeping to its original design) Support for metacity-themes has finally been upgraded to version 3 in the marco window manager We’ve also modernized the window and desktop switchers to make them more visually appealing The session manager now properly terminates all processes on systemd. Also, apps can be auto-started after a user-selected delay We’ve fully ported a number of programs to Python 3, including the eye of MATE and python-caja plugin libraries, as well as the mate-menus library The caja file manager can now optionally display desktop notifications for long-running file operations Eye of MATE has a reworked sidebar and better image metadata support Tabs in pluma now have the ability to be switched with keyboard shortcuts and mouse scrolling Calculator can now support up to 15 characters of accuracy. Copy/paste support was also improved a bit Engrampa has had support added for several new compression formats, as well as a new pause/restart functionality A few new key shortcuts have been added, including support for different types of media keys like Bluetooth, WiFi, touchpads, and global killswitches A bunch of internal housekeeping tasks have been taken care of: Most of our projects have now migrated from dbus-glib to GDBus We’ve improved stability across many of our projects by closing memory leaks and build warnings We’ve removed old deprecated code to keep up with the latest versions of GTK A lot of new and updated documentation was added/corrected All of our projects now use Travis CI to ensure clean builds on some of our major distros The various components of MATE Desktop 1.22 are available for download here:\nhttps://pub.mate-desktop.org/releases/1.22/"},"title":"MATE 1.22 released"},"/blog/2020-02-10-mate-1-24-released/":{"data":{"":"After about a year of development, the MATE Desktop team have finally released MATE 1.24.

release contains plenty of new features, bug-fixes, and general improvements. Some of the most important highlights include:\nWe did it again, the MATE desktop environment is easier to use than before, once the user starts the session. Do you want to hide applications startup? Now you can set which applications to show on startup. Engrampa now has support for a handful of extra formats, as well as fixed support for passwords and unicode characters in some of them. Eye of MATE now has support for Wayland and we’ve added support for embedded color profiles. The thumbnail generation has been reworked and fixed in several places. Added support for webp files. Our window manager, marco, has gotten quite a few changes: We’ve brought a bunch of window decorations from the past to feed your nostalgia. Finally added invisible resize borders. No more struggling to find a border to grab with your mouse! All window controls (you know, the min, max, close buttons) are now rendered in HiDPI. The Alt+Tab and Workspace Switcher popups have been entirely reworked. Now they render in beautiful OSD style, are more configurable, and can respond to keyboard arrows. Tiling windows with the keyboard now allows you to cycle through different window sizes. You no longer need to feel constrained by only half of your screen. The System Monitor panel applet now has support for NVMe drives. Calculator now supports using either “pi” or “π”. Scientific notation has been improved. Some fixes for supporting pre-defined physical constants. The Control Center now displays its icons correctly on HiDPI displays. A brand new Time And Date Manager app has been added. The Mouse app now supports acceleration profiles. The Preferred Applications app has been improved for accessibility, as well as better support for integration with IM clients. The Indicator Applet has slightly better interaction with oddly-sized icons. Speaking of icons, the network manager applet icons in our own themes have been entirely redesigned and can now be enjoyed on HiDPI displays. If you’re the type of person that does not like to be disturbed when busy, or giving a presentation, or watching a movie, you’ll be happy to know that the notification daemon now supports a Do-Not-Disturb mode. The MATE Panel had several bugs that caused crashes in the past when changing layouts. Those are now fixed! Support for Wayland compatibility has improved considerably. Status icons (a.k.a. notification area, or system tray) have support for HiDPI displays. Wanda the Fish got a make-over and now you can enjoy her in full HiDPI glory. The window list applet now supports window thumbnails on hover. Various accessibility improvements throughout the panel and its core applets. If your system doesn’t, uh, support systemd you might be interested in knowing that we’ve added support for elogind to both the MATE Screensaver and the MATE Session. We’ve also added a brand new MATE Disk Image Mounter utility. Mozo, the menu editor, now supports Undo and Redo actions. Pluma plugins have now fully switched to Python 3. Pluma no longer has to envy anything from other complex editors, since it can now show the formatting marks. i18n: All applications have been migrated from intltools to gettext.

While all the added features are surely quite exciting we also did not forget to do tons of bugfixing, modernising the code base and optimizing the performance.\nThe headline changes in MATE Desktop 1.26 are:\nWe added Wayland support for Atril, System Monitor, Pluma, Terminal and other components of the Desktop. Furthermore Calculator and Terminal can now be built with Meson. Pluma was subject to massive improvements. There is a new mini map which gives you instant overview over the content. The new grid background pattern turns Pluma into a writing pad. The sort plugin now supports undo actions. We added a show/hide line-numbers shortcut, namely Ctrl + Y. The preferences dialog needed a redesign to catch up with all the new features. Together with the brand new Pluma Plugins our text editor can be turned into a feature-rich IDE with support for Bracket completion, Comment/Uncomment code, Built-in terminal and Word completion. The Control Center features an improved Windows preferences dialog with more options. In the Display dialog we added an option for display scaling. Notifications became even more useful as they gained support for hyperlinks. And we finally added a Do not Disturb applet. Speaking of applets, the Window List applet has a new option to disable mouse scrolling. The optional window thumbnails are now crisp and clear as they are rendered as cairo surfaces. The Netspeed applet shows more information by default and gained netlink support. The Calculator was ported to the GNU MPFR/MPC library which means more precision, faster computation and additional functions (e.g. Riemann zeta function, Gauss error function). We finally added a history to show recent computations. Calculator is now resizeable when the history is activated. Vastly improved integer factorization speed. Much faster modular arithmetic evaluation (modular exponentiation ability). In the file manager Caja you can select a new Bookmarks sidebar. Caja gained support for formatting drives from the context menu. The Caja Actions extension which allows you to add arbitrary programs to be launched through the context menu is now part of the Desktop. Scrolling through large documents in Atril is a lot faster now since a slow linear search has been replaced by a binary tree search. The document viewer’s memory footprint got even smaller as a EvWebView is now only created if needed. The window manager Marco now restores minimized windows to its original position more reliable. Engrampa got support for Electronic Publication (EPUB) and ARC archives. In addition it can now open encrypted RAR archives. The Power Manager has a new option to enable keyboard dimming and has been ported to libsecret. Most About dialogs have been updated with nicer descriptions. Because small things matter :-). We fixed a lot of bugs, some memory leaks and modernised the codebase of almost all of the Desktop components. There is a new Wiki which makes it easier for new contributors to join our project. We urgently need motivated people so do not hesitate to contact us or start contributing. Translations are updated. Thank you to our team of translators!

This release focuses on enhancing Wayland support, updating various applications, and fixing numerous bugs.\nMATE 1.28 has made significant strides in updating the codebase, including the removal of deprecated libraries and ensuring compatibility with the latest GTK versions. One of the most notable improvements is the enhanced support for Wayland, bringing us closer to a fully native MATE-Wayland experience. Several components have been updated to work seamlessly with Wayland, ensuring a more integrated and responsive desktop environment.\nThe headline changes in MATE Desktop 1.28 are:\nAtril now uses libarchive for handling comics, supports webkitgtk 4.2.1, and has documented its EPUB support. Deprecated methods have been replaced with modern counterparts to improve performance and stability. Caja can now manage desktop icons, render backgrounds, and change backgrounds in Wayland sessions. These improvements enhance the user experience and bring greater functionality to Wayland users. Engrampa has introduced support for the Meson build system, switched to using unar for CPIO archives, and now supports unrar-free. These updates improve compatibility and performance. The Eye of MATE image viewer now supports the Meson build system and includes fixes for several build warnings, contributing to a more stable and efficient application. The window manager Marco has added a new setting to raise windows on the alt+tab popup and replaced various deprecated methods to ensure better performance and user experience. Many panel applets now support Wayland, with improvements for in-process building and specific applet functionality under Wayland. Memory leaks have been fixed, and accessibility improvements have been made. The control center now works in both Wayland and X11 sessions, supports the Meson build system, and includes several UI and memory leak fixes. Pluma has a new Quickhighlight Plugin in the pluma-plugins package. MATE Terminal now has Meson build system support. Copying a file from Caja into the terminal now works as expected (it inserts the file path). Additional enhancements include support for OSC 8 hyperlinks and improvements to tab management.
